# talking-ganesha
This project is about using Raspberry pi with USB microphone and Speaker for interactive answering machine. We are calling it Talking Ganesha. In Hindu Culture , God Ganesha is called as God of Knowledge. We have created this project just to create Talking Ganesha in Ganesh Festival.
We have used Google Speech API for coverting speech to text, WolfarmAlpha API for asnwering questions and then eSpeak to answer the answer return by WolframAlpha.

Note that it needs internet connection.
